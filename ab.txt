Calculations :

Design a USBR stilling basin II for an overflow spillway with the following data:
Design discharge (in cumec)										
TW level 	(in meter)										
Basin width	(in cumec)										
Elevation of ground	(in meter)									
Velocity at the foot of the spillway	(in meter/sec)						

8.5  Procedure
i) Determine the initial depth h1 using the eqn h1= Q/BU1	(in meter)		         
ii)Find the upstream Froude number Fr1.							
iii)  Compute the sequent depth h2 using the formula  h2/h1 = 1/2 (âˆš(1+8Fr_1^2 )-1)     
iv)  Check the sequent depth and tailwater level and adjust them with safety 
      margin.
v)  Determine the length of basin (L), width, height and spacing of chute blocks and 
     dentated sills using the formulas given in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 and show them in 
     neat sketches.

Results  :

	Design discharge (Q) 	(in cumec)								
	TW level (ht)	(in meter)								
	Initial depth 	(h1)	(in meter)							
	Froude number (Fr1)								
	Sequent depth (h2)	(in meter)							
	Floor elevation	Length of basin (L)	(in meter)
